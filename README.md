SunnySide
===================


This application was made during the six hour hackathon Gothenburg Startup Hack 2016. It aims to predict where shadows will fall in the city of Gothenburg based on the sun's position relative to you and surrounding buildings. The 3D data is a sample set of one of Gothenburg's districts provided by the Municipality of Gothenburg.
